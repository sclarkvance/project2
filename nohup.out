sendMessage running    No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
sendMessage running    But he shall know I am as good
sendMessage running  MAYOR. O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
sendMessage running  PUCELLE. What you do, good grey beard? Break a
sendMessage running    Therefore stand up; and for these good deserts
sendMessage running  BASSET. Why, what is he? As good a man as York!
sendMessage running    And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Well, my good lord, and as the only means
sendMessage running    Your purpose is both good and reasonable,
sendMessage running  MARGARET. Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart,
sendMessage running    Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
sendMessage running  SUFFOLK. Tush, my good lord! This superficial tale
sendMessage running    And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
sendMessage running    Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,'
sendMessage running    With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
sendMessage running    Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.
sendMessage running  DUCHESS. Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
sendMessage running  SECOND PETITIONER. Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good
sendMessage running  DUCHESS. Against her will, good King? Look to 't in time;
sendMessage running    me. I have good witness of this; therefore I beseech your
sendMessage running  BOLINGBROKE. Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
sendMessage running    See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
sendMessage running  YORK. At your pleasure, my good lord.
sendMessage running    Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?
sendMessage running    So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
sendMessage running  QUEEN. Tell me, good fellow, cam'st thou here by chance,
sendMessage running    By good Saint Alban, who said 'Simpcox, come,
sendMessage running  SIMPCOX. Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
sendMessage running  YORK. Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
sendMessage running    That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey;
sendMessage running    Farewell, good King; when I am dead and gone,
sendMessage running  QUEEN. Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore
sendMessage running  THIRD NEIGHBOUR. And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour;
sendMessage running  YORK. Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in
sendMessage running    Ay, night by night- in studying good for England!
sendMessage running    For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.        Exit, guarded
sendMessage running    And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
sendMessage running    Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
sendMessage running    So he be dead; for that is good deceit
sendMessage running    No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. 'Tis, my good lord.
sendMessage running    Than from true evidence, of good esteem,
sendMessage running    That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
sendMessage running    And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.
sendMessage running    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
sendMessage running    Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
sendMessage running    And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
sendMessage running  GEORGE. Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.
sendMessage running  DICK. [Aside] He was an honest man and a good bricklayer.
sendMessage running  CADE. I thank you, good people- there shall be no money; all shall
sendMessage running    encount'red with a man as good as himself. He is but a knight,
sendMessage running    It is to you, good people, that I speak,
sendMessage running  CADE. And good reason; for thereby is England main'd and fain to go
sendMessage running    enemy be a good counsellor, or no?
sendMessage running    Continue still in this so good a mind,
sendMessage running    He were created knight for his good service.
sendMessage running  WARWICK. What good is this to England and himself!
sendMessage running    Thou art as opposite to every good

sendMessage running  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
sendMessage running    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
sendMessage running    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.
sendMessage running    Fight closer or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
sendMessage running  LADY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
sendMessage running    And yet too good to be your concubine.
sendMessage running    As may appear by Edward's good success,
sendMessage running    Now for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
sendMessage running    He hath good usage and great liberty;
sendMessage running  MAYOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
sendMessage running  HASTINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
sendMessage running    I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
sendMessage running    Stand we in good array, for they no doubt
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
sendMessage running    As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
sendMessage running    Would by a good discourser lose some life
sendMessage running  NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
sendMessage running    My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches
sendMessage running    On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take good heed
sendMessage running  CHAMBERLAIN. As far as I see, all the good our English
sendMessage running    Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
sendMessage running    As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
sendMessage running    As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,

sendMessage running    That angels love good men with; even of her
sendMessage running  NORFOLK. Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.
sendMessage running    Who's there? My good Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey,
sendMessage running    Use us and it.  [To WOLSEY]  My good lord, have great care
sendMessage running    One general tongue unto us, this good man,
sendMessage running    For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,
sendMessage running    So good a lady that no tongue could ever

sendMessage running  ANNE. My good lord,
sendMessage running    The action of good women; there is hope
sendMessage running    Commends his good opinion of you to you, and
sendMessage running    And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
sendMessage running    Or touch of her good person?
sendMessage running    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,
sendMessage running    Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points
sendMessage running    They should be good men, their affairs as righteous;
sendMessage running  QUEEN KATHARINE. O, good my lord, no Latin!
sendMessage running    To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
sendMessage running    You have too much, good lady; but to know
sendMessage running    Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
sendMessage running    My lords, I thank you both for your good wins;
sendMessage running    You turn the good we offer into envy.
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
sendMessage running    You'd feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,
sendMessage running    And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well;
sendMessage running    To th' good of your most sacred person and
sendMessage running    That for your Highness' good I ever labour'd
sendMessage running    So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
sendMessage running    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
sendMessage running    Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
sendMessage running  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Alas, good lady!                       [Trumpets]
sendMessage running    Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's,
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.
sendMessage running    To hear me speak his good now?
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. Yes, good Griffith;
sendMessage running    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
sendMessage running    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
sendMessage running  GRIFFITH. I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
sendMessage running    And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. O my good lord, that comfort comes too late,
sendMessage running  CAPUCIUS. Madam, in good health.
sendMessage running    A right good husband, let him be a noble;
sendMessage running    These are the whole contents; and, good my lord,
sendMessage running    Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
sendMessage running    She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
sendMessage running  LOVELL. Many good nights, my lord; I rest your servant.
sendMessage running  KING. Alas, good lady!
sendMessage running    A quiet night, and my good mistress will

sendMessage running    My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
sendMessage running    Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,
sendMessage running    And am right glad to catch this good occasion
sendMessage running  KING. Stand up, good Canterbury;
sendMessage running    The good I stand on is my truth and honesty;
sendMessage running  KING. Be of good cheer;
sendMessage running    There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!
sendMessage running    Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels
sendMessage running    At least good manners-as not thus to suffer

sendMessage running    You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
sendMessage running    By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
sendMessage running  CRANMER. Stay, good my lords,
sendMessage running    Not only good and wise but most religious;
sendMessage running  KING. You were ever good at sudden commendations,

sendMessage running    All the expected good w'are like to hear
sendMessage running    The merciful construction of good women;
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
sendMessage running    Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
sendMessage running    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
sendMessage running    Philip, good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
sendMessage running    O me, 'tis my mother! How now, good lady!
sendMessage running  GURNEY. Good leave, good Philip.
sendMessage running    We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
sendMessage running    Then, good my mother, let me know my father-
sendMessage running  KING PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
sendMessage running  ELINOR. There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
sendMessage running  CONSTANCE. There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
sendMessage running    There's a good grandam!
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. What other harm have I, good lady, done
sendMessage running    And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
sendMessage running    To say what good respect I have of thee.
sendMessage running  KING PHILIP. Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
sendMessage running    Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
sendMessage running  ARTHUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
sendMessage running    The rich advantage of good exercise?
sendMessage running    As good to die and go, as die and stay.              [Leaps down]
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Away, then, with good courage!
sendMessage running  MESSENGER. Be of good comfort; for the great supply

sendMessage running    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-
sendMessage running    Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
sendMessage running  CASSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
sendMessage running    four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and forgave
sendMessage running    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
sendMessage running    Will purchase us a good opinion,
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
sendMessage running    And so, good morrow to you every one.
sendMessage running    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,

sendMessage running    Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
sendMessage running    Our reasons are so full of good regard

sendMessage running     His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!
sendMessage running  Lear. Come, good Athenian.
sendMessage running  Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

sendMessage running  BEROWNE. Amen, so I had mine! Is not that a good word?
sendMessage running    Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me.
sendMessage running    Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?

sendMessage running    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;

sendMessage running  DICK. [Aside] He was an honest man and a good bricklayer.
sendMessage running  CADE. I thank you, good people- there shall be no money; all shall
sendMessage running    encount'red with a man as good as himself. He is but a knight,
sendMessage running    It is to you, good people, that I speak,

sendMessage running    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,

sendMessage running    To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
sendMessage running    You have too much, good lady; but to know
sendMessage running    Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
sendMessage running    My lords, I thank you both for your good wins;

sendMessage running  WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

sendMessage running    This story shall the good man teach his son;
sendMessage running  BOY. He prays you to save his life; he is a gentleman of a good

sendMessage running    With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
sendMessage running    Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.
sendMessage running  DUCHESS. Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.

sendMessage running    See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
sendMessage running  YORK. At your pleasure, my good lord.
sendMessage running    Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?

sendMessage running  SIMPCOX. Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
sendMessage running  YORK. Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
sendMessage running    That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey;

sendMessage running  YORK. Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in
sendMessage running    Ay, night by night- in studying good for England!
sendMessage running    For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.        Exit, guarded
sendMessage running    And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
sendMessage running    Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
sendMessage running    So he be dead; for that is good deceit
sendMessage running    No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. 'Tis, my good lord.
sendMessage running    Than from true evidence, of good esteem,
sendMessage running    That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
sendMessage running    And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.
sendMessage running    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
sendMessage running    Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
sendMessage running    And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
sendMessage running  GEORGE. Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.
sendMessage running  DICK. [Aside] He was an honest man and a good bricklayer.
sendMessage running  CADE. I thank you, good people- there shall be no money; all shall
sendMessage running    encount'red with a man as good as himself. He is but a knight,
sendMessage running    It is to you, good people, that I speak,
sendMessage running  CADE. And good reason; for thereby is England main'd and fain to go

sendMessage running    Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
sendMessage running    Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.
sendMessage running    Fight closer or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
sendMessage running  LADY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
sendMessage running    And yet too good to be your concubine.
sendMessage running    As may appear by Edward's good success,
sendMessage running    Now for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
sendMessage running    He hath good usage and great liberty;
sendMessage running  MAYOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
sendMessage running  HASTINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
sendMessage running    I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
sendMessage running    Stand we in good array, for they no doubt
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
sendMessage running    As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.
sendMessage running    Would by a good discourser lose some life
sendMessage running  NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion
sendMessage running    My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches
sendMessage running    On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take good heed
sendMessage running  CHAMBERLAIN. As far as I see, all the good our English

sendMessage running    As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
sendMessage running    As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,

sendMessage running    A good digestion to you all; and once more
sendMessage running    By all your good leaves, gentlemen, here I'll make
sendMessage running  BUCKINGHAM. All good people,
sendMessage running    Go with me like good angels to my end;

sendMessage running    To the good Queen, possess'd him with a scruple
sendMessage running    That angels love good men with; even of her

sendMessage running    Who's there? My good Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey,
sendMessage running    Use us and it.  [To WOLSEY]  My good lord, have great care
sendMessage running    One general tongue unto us, this good man,
sendMessage running    For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,

sendMessage running  ANNE. My good lord,
sendMessage running    The action of good women; there is hope
sendMessage running    Commends his good opinion of you to you, and
sendMessage running    And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
sendMessage running    Or touch of her good person?
sendMessage running    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,
sendMessage running    Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points
sendMessage running    They should be good men, their affairs as righteous;
sendMessage running  QUEEN KATHARINE. O, good my lord, no Latin!
sendMessage running    To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
sendMessage running    You have too much, good lady; but to know
sendMessage running    Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
sendMessage running    My lords, I thank you both for your good wins;
sendMessage running    You turn the good we offer into envy.
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
sendMessage running    You'd feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,
sendMessage running    And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well;
sendMessage running    To th' good of your most sacred person and
sendMessage running    That for your Highness' good I ever labour'd
sendMessage running    So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.
sendMessage running    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
sendMessage running    Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
sendMessage running  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Alas, good lady!                       [Trumpets]
sendMessage running    Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's,
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.
sendMessage running    To hear me speak his good now?
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. Yes, good Griffith;
sendMessage running    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
sendMessage running    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
sendMessage running  GRIFFITH. I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
sendMessage running    And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. O my good lord, that comfort comes too late,
sendMessage running  CAPUCIUS. Madam, in good health.
sendMessage running    A right good husband, let him be a noble;
sendMessage running    These are the whole contents; and, good my lord,
sendMessage running    Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
sendMessage running    She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
sendMessage running  LOVELL. Many good nights, my lord; I rest your servant.
sendMessage running  KING. Alas, good lady!
sendMessage running    A quiet night, and my good mistress will

sendMessage running    My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
sendMessage running    Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,
sendMessage running    And am right glad to catch this good occasion
sendMessage running  KING. Stand up, good Canterbury;
sendMessage running    The good I stand on is my truth and honesty;
sendMessage running  KING. Be of good cheer;
sendMessage running    There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!
sendMessage running    Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels
sendMessage running    At least good manners-as not thus to suffer
sendMessage running  CHANCELLOR. My good Lord Archbishop, I am very sorry
sendMessage running  CRANMER. My good lords, hitherto in all the progress
sendMessage running  CRANMER. Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;
sendMessage running    You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
sendMessage running    By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
sendMessage running  CRANMER. Stay, good my lords,
sendMessage running    Not only good and wise but most religious;

sendMessage running    All the expected good w'are like to hear
sendMessage running    The merciful construction of good women;
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
sendMessage running    Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
sendMessage running    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
sendMessage running    Philip, good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
sendMessage running    O me, 'tis my mother! How now, good lady!
sendMessage running  GURNEY. Good leave, good Philip.
sendMessage running    We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
sendMessage running    Then, good my mother, let me know my father-
sendMessage running  KING PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
sendMessage running  ELINOR. There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
sendMessage running  CONSTANCE. There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
sendMessage running    There's a good grandam!
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. What other harm have I, good lady, done
sendMessage running    And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
sendMessage running    To say what good respect I have of thee.
sendMessage running  KING PHILIP. Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
sendMessage running    Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
sendMessage running  ARTHUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
sendMessage running    The rich advantage of good exercise?
sendMessage running    As good to die and go, as die and stay.              [Leaps down]
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?

sendMessage running    four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and forgave
sendMessage running    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
sendMessage running    Will purchase us a good opinion,

sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
sendMessage running    And so, good morrow to you every one.
sendMessage running    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,

sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.

sendMessage running  Lear. Come, good Athenian.

sendMessage running    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
sendMessage running  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
sendMessage running  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift

sendMessage running  Man. No, my good lord.
sendMessage running    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
sendMessage running  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,

sendMessage running  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
sendMessage running    Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
sendMessage running  FIRST HUNTSMAN. Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;

sendMessage running  SLY. Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes there
sendMessage running    good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

sendMessage running    love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
sendMessage running    needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between

sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent

sendMessage running    Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
sendMessage running    No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
sendMessage running    But he shall know I am as good
sendMessage running  MAYOR. O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
sendMessage running  PUCELLE. What you do, good grey beard? Break a

sendMessage running  SUFFOLK. Tush, my good lord! This superficial tale
sendMessage running    And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
sendMessage running    Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,'
sendMessage running    With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
sendMessage running    Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.
sendMessage running  DUCHESS. Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
sendMessage running  SECOND PETITIONER. Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good
sendMessage running  DUCHESS. Against her will, good King? Look to 't in time;

sendMessage running    See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
sendMessage running  YORK. At your pleasure, my good lord.
sendMessage running    Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?
sendMessage running    So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.

sendMessage running    No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. 'Tis, my good lord.
sendMessage running    Than from true evidence, of good esteem,
sendMessage running    That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
sendMessage running    And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.
sendMessage running    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;

sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!

sendMessage running    encount'red with a man as good as himself. He is but a knight,
sendMessage running    It is to you, good people, that I speak,

sendMessage running    Fight closer or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have
sendMessage running  LADY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.
sendMessage running    And yet too good to be your concubine.
sendMessage running    As may appear by Edward's good success,
sendMessage running    Now for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
sendMessage running    He hath good usage and great liberty;
sendMessage running  MAYOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
sendMessage running  HASTINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
sendMessage running    I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
sendMessage running    Stand we in good array, for they no doubt

sendMessage running    As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.

sendMessage running  NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion

sendMessage running    Who's there? My good Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey,
sendMessage running    Use us and it.  [To WOLSEY]  My good lord, have great care

sendMessage running    Commends his good opinion of you to you, and
sendMessage running    And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
sendMessage running    Or touch of her good person?
sendMessage running    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,
sendMessage running    Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points
sendMessage running    They should be good men, their affairs as righteous;
sendMessage running  QUEEN KATHARINE. O, good my lord, no Latin!
sendMessage running    To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
sendMessage running    You have too much, good lady; but to know
sendMessage running    Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
sendMessage running    My lords, I thank you both for your good wins;
sendMessage running    You turn the good we offer into envy.
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
sendMessage running    You'd feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,
sendMessage running    And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well;
sendMessage running    To th' good of your most sacred person and
sendMessage running    That for your Highness' good I ever labour'd
sendMessage running    So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.

sendMessage running    To hear me speak his good now?
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. Yes, good Griffith;
sendMessage running    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
sendMessage running    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
sendMessage running  GRIFFITH. I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
sendMessage running    And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
sendMessage running  KATHARINE. O my good lord, that comfort comes too late,
sendMessage running  CAPUCIUS. Madam, in good health.
sendMessage running    A right good husband, let him be a noble;
sendMessage running    These are the whole contents; and, good my lord,
sendMessage running    Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,

sendMessage running    Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,

sendMessage running    The good I stand on is my truth and honesty;
sendMessage running  KING. Be of good cheer;
sendMessage running    There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!
sendMessage running    Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels

sendMessage running    The merciful construction of good women;
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
sendMessage running    Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
sendMessage running    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
sendMessage running    Philip, good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son.

sendMessage running  GURNEY. Good leave, good Philip.
sendMessage running    We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,

sendMessage running    Then, good my mother, let me know my father-

sendMessage running    And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
sendMessage running    To say what good respect I have of thee.
sendMessage running  KING PHILIP. Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
sendMessage running    Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
sendMessage running  ARTHUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,

sendMessage running    As good to die and go, as die and stay.              [Leaps down]
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.

sendMessage running    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
sendMessage running    Will purchase us a good opinion,

sendMessage running    And so, good morrow to you every one.
sendMessage running    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,

sendMessage running  Lear. Come, good Athenian.
sendMessage running  Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

sendMessage running  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made

sendMessage running    Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;

sendMessage running    The offers we have sent you.
sendMessage running  POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
sendMessage running  POMPEY. We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's

sendMessage running    Why so am I: we still have slept together,
sendMessage running    And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
sendMessage running    Still we went coupled and inseparable.

sendMessage running    The like do you; so shall we pass along,
sendMessage running  ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
sendMessage running    After my flight. Now go we in content
sendMessage running    Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
sendMessage running  DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
sendMessage running    Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we

sendMessage running  ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?

sendMessage running            Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
sendMessage running            How thus we met, and these things finish.
sendMessage running    As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.    [A dance] Exeunt

sendMessage running  We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
sendMessage running  But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain,
sendMessage running  As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
sendMessage running  For if we two be one, and thou play false,
sendMessage running  If we obey them not, this will ensue:
sendMessage runningLUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
sendMessage runningANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
sendMessage runningBALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
sendMessage runningANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
sendMessage running  There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
sendMessage running  To her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
sendMessage running  If every one knows us, and we know none,
sendMessage runningDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is where we din'd,
sendMessage running  there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?
sendMessage running  And here we wander in illusions.
sendMessage running  But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
sendMessage running  I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
sendMessage running  This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.
sendMessage running  Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,
sendMessage runningANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
sendMessage running  He shall not die; so much we tender him.
sendMessage running  Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
sendMessage running  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
sendMessage running  Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,

sendMessage running  Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,
sendMessage running  I see we still did meet each other's man,
sendMessage running  And we shall make full satisfaction.
sendMessage runningDROMIO OF EPHESUS. That's a question; how shall we try it?

sendMessage running    had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll

sendMessage running  FIRST CITIZEN. We cannot, sir; we are undone already.
sendMessage running  MARCIUS. I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent
sendMessage running    [To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
sendMessage running  SICINIUS. When we were chosen tribunes for the people-

sendMessage running    That we with smoking swords may march from hence
sendMessage running    Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
sendMessage running  COMINIUS. Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off
sendMessage running    We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
sendMessage running    By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
sendMessage running    Lead their successes as we wish our own,
sendMessage running  COMINIUS. 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
sendMessage running    By all the battles wherein we have fought,
sendMessage running    By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows
sendMessage running    For a short holding. If we lose the field
sendMessage running    Here is the steed, we the caparison.
sendMessage running    Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
sendMessage running    Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
sendMessage running    Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
sendMessage running    The best, with whom we may articulate
sendMessage running    Have we no wine here?
sendMessage running  COMINIUS. Go we to our tent.
sendMessage running    And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
sendMessage running    As often as we eat. By th' elements,
sendMessage running  MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.

sendMessage running  THIRD CITIZEN. He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.
sendMessage running    A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
sendMessage running    To be set high in place, we did commend
sendMessage running    Which we have goaded onward.                          Exeunt
sendMessage running    That we shall hardly in our ages see
sendMessage running    In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate

sendMessage running  FIRST SENATOR. No more words, we beseech you.
sendMessage running    Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought

sendMessage running  BRUTUS. By the consent of all we were establish'd
sendMessage running    And we their hands.
sendMessage running    For we are peremptory to dispatch

sendMessage running    When we shall hap to give't them.
sendMessage running    And we of thee; so, if the time thrust forth
sendMessage running    A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
sendMessage running    The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Now we have shown our power,
sendMessage running  SICINIUS. Why stay we to be baited
sendMessage running    Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
sendMessage running    Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
sendMessage running  SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too
sendMessage running    not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends,
sendMessage running  SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
sendMessage running  SICINIUS. We hear not of him, neither need we fear him.
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Farewell, kind neighbours; we wish'd Coriolanus
sendMessage running    Had lov'd you as we did.
sendMessage running    There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
sendMessage running  BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not we brought it.
sendMessage running  PLEBEIANS. Faith, we hear fearful news.
sendMessage running    many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we

sendMessage running    Whene'er we come to our account.
sendMessage running    That we have bled together. 'Coriolanus'
sendMessage running    And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:
sendMessage running    More than the instant army we can make,
sendMessage running    To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
sendMessage running    With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
sendMessage running    In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
sendMessage running  FIRST WATCH. Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
sendMessage running    For we have nothing else to ask but that
sendMessage running    Which you deny already; yet we will ask,
sendMessage running  VOLUMNIA. Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
sendMessage running    Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should

sendMessage running    Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
sendMessage running    Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
sendMessage running    Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
sendMessage running    An evident calamity, though we had
sendMessage running    May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans
sendMessage running    'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
sendMessage running    This is the last. So we will home to Rome,
sendMessage running    But we will drink together; and you shall bear
sendMessage running    When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to
sendMessage running    When we banish'd him we respected not them; and, he returning to
sendMessage running  SECOND MESSENGER. Sir, we have all

sendMessage running    When shall we see again?
sendMessage running    When shall we hear from him?
sendMessage running  FRENCHMAN. I have seen him in France; we had very many there could

sendMessage running    him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
sendMessage running    Upon the number'd beach, and can we not

sendMessage running  IACHIMO. Good sir, we must,
sendMessage running    A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
sendMessage running    we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket,
sendMessage running    or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light;
sendMessage running    This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar's ambition-
sendMessage running    Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
sendMessage running    Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
sendMessage running    That we two are asunder- let that grieve him!
sendMessage running    How we may steal from hence; and for the gap
sendMessage running    That we shall make in time from our hence-going
sendMessage running    How many score of miles may we well ride
sendMessage running    Draws us a profit from all things we see,
sendMessage running    And often to our comfort shall we find
sendMessage running  ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of
sendMessage running    When we are old as you? When we shall hear
sendMessage running    When we are old as you? When we shall hear
sendMessage running    In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse.
sendMessage running    Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.
sendMessage running    And we will fear no poison, which attends
sendMessage running  IMOGEN. Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
sendMessage running  PISANIO. Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
sendMessage running    That we have given him cause.
sendMessage running    That will be given to th' loud of noise we make.
sendMessage running    Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
sendMessage running    By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
sendMessage running    Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
sendMessage running    The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
sendMessage running    Are we not brothers?
sendMessage running  ARVIRAGUS. In this place we left them.
sendMessage running  GUIDERIUS. Why, worthy father, what have we to lose
sendMessage running    Protects not us; then why should we be tender
sendMessage running    For we do fear the law? What company
sendMessage running    Can we set eye on, but in an safe reason
sendMessage running    It may be heard at court that such as we
sendMessage running    Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,
sendMessage running    If we do fear this body hath a tail
sendMessage running    Of what we blame him for!
sendMessage running    That we have made so much on. I had rather
sendMessage running  GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East;
sendMessage running    These herblets shall which we upon you strew.
sendMessage running    That we the horrider may seem to those
sendMessage running    Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
sendMessage running  ARVIRAGUS. What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
sendMessage running    Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans
sendMessage running    Of Cloten's death- we being not known, not muster'd
sendMessage running    Where we have liv'd, and so extort from's that
sendMessage running    Which we have done, whose answer would be death,
sendMessage running    To know from whence we are.
sendMessage running    Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods.            Exit
sendMessage running    Or we are Romans and will give you that,
sendMessage running    Sweet words; or hath moe ministers than we
sendMessage running  SECOND BROTHER. For this from stiller seats we came,
sendMessage running              Or we poor ghosts will cry
sendMessage running  BROTHERS. Help, Jupiter! or we appeal,
sendMessage running    one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, there
sendMessage running    In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen;
sendMessage running    Unless I add we are honest.
sendMessage running  GUIDERIUS. But we saw him dead.
sendMessage running    And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein
sendMessage running    That we meet here so strangely; but her son
sendMessage running    Is gone, we know not how nor where.
sendMessage running    Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
sendMessage running    When we were so indeed.
sendMessage running    Continu'd so until we thought he died.
sendMessage running    Joy'd are we that you are.
sendMessage running    Which we call 'mollis aer,' and 'mollis aer'
sendMessage running    My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
sendMessage running    Although the victor, we submit to Caesar
sendMessage running  CYMBELINE. Laud we the gods;
sendMessage running    From our bless'd altars. Publish we this peace
sendMessage running    To all our subjects. Set we forward; let
sendMessage running    What we two nights have seen.
sendMessage running  Hor. Well, sit we down,
sendMessage running    Break we our watch up; and by my advice
sendMessage running    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
sendMessage running    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
sendMessage running    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
sendMessage running    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
sendMessage running    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
sendMessage running    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
sendMessage running    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
sendMessage running  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
sendMessage running    For what we know must be, and is as common
sendMessage running    Why should we in our peevish opposition
sendMessage running    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
sendMessage running  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
sendMessage running    And we did think it writ down in our duty
sendMessage running    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
sendMessage running    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
sendMessage running    Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
sendMessage running    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
sendMessage running  Both. My lord, we will not.
sendMessage running    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
sendMessage running    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
sendMessage running    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
sendMessage running    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
sendMessage running    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
sendMessage running    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
sendMessage running    The need we have to use you did provoke
sendMessage running  Guil. But we both obey,
sendMessage running  King. Well, we shall sift him.
sendMessage running    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
sendMessage running    That we find out the cause of this effect-
sendMessage running    And all we mourn for.
sendMessage running  King. How may we try it further?
sendMessage running  Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
sendMessage running    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
sendMessage running    heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
sendMessage running  Guil. What should we say, my lord?
sendMessage running  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
sendMessage running    anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
sendMessage running      But, as we often see, against some storm,
sendMessage running  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
sendMessage running    When we would bring him on to some confession
sendMessage running    We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
sendMessage running    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
sendMessage running    And pious action we do sugar o'er
sendMessage running    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
sendMessage running    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
sendMessage running    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
sendMessage running    Than fly to others that we know not of?
sendMessage running    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
sendMessage running    me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
sendMessage running  Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
sendMessage running    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
sendMessage running    And after we will both our judgments join
sendMessage running      But what we do determine oft we break.
sendMessage running      But what we do determine oft we break.
sendMessage running      Most necessary 'tis that we forget
sendMessage running      What to ourselves in passion we propose,
sendMessage running    work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
sendMessage running    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
sendMessage running    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
sendMessage running    In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
sendMessage running    You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
sendMessage running    It had been so with us, had we been there.
sendMessage running    But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
sendMessage running    And let them know both what we mean to do
sendMessage running  Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
sendMessage running    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
sendMessage running    we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
sendMessage running    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
sendMessage running    Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
sendMessage running    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
sendMessage running    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
sendMessage running    Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
sendMessage running    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
sendMessage running    Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
sendMessage running  All. We will, we will!
sendMessage running           And we cast away moan.
sendMessage running    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
sendMessage running    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
sendMessage running    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
sendMessage running    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
sendMessage running    slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
sendMessage running    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
sendMessage running    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
sendMessage running    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
sendMessage running    Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
sendMessage running    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
sendMessage running    and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
sendMessage running  Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many

sendMessage running    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
sendMessage running    Rough-hew them how we will-
sendMessage running  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
sendMessage running  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
sendMessage running  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
sendMessage running    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
sendMessage running  King. So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
sendMessage running    Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
sendMessage running    Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
sendMessage running    And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.
sendMessage running    Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
sendMessage running    And for this cause awhile we must neglect
sendMessage running    Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
sendMessage running  Fal. Indeed you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go
sendMessage running    Minions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good
sendMessage running    mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
sendMessage running  Prince. Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
sendMessage running    Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men
sendMessage running    Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have
sendMessage running  Prince. How shall we part with them in setting forth?
sendMessage running  Poins. Why, we will set forth before or after them and appoint them
sendMessage running    wood; our wizards we will change after we leave them; and,
sendMessage running    wood; our wizards we will change after we leave them; and,
sendMessage running    rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least,
sendMessage running    Tou have good leave to leave us. When we need
sendMessage running    'Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
sendMessage running    That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
sendMessage running    Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
sendMessage running    Shall we buy treason? and indent with fears
sendMessage running  Wor. And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
sendMessage running    For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
sendMessage running    And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
sendMessage running    Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
sendMessage running  2. Car. Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we leak in
sendMessage running    a castle, cocksure. We have the receipt of fernseed, we walk
sendMessage running  Prince. Well, we leave that to the proof.
sendMessage running  Traveller. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
sendMessage running  Traveller. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
sendMessage running    this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The purpose
sendMessage running    Hang him, let him tell the King! we are prepared. I will set
sendMessage running    Such as we see when men restrain their breath
sendMessage running    door. Shall we be merry?
sendMessage running  Gads. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men sea upon us-
sendMessage running    down. Then did we two set on you four and, with a word, outfac'd
sendMessage running    What, shall we be merry? Shall we have a play extempore?

sendMessage running    civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy
sendMessage running  Fal. By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we shall have
sendMessage running  Glend. Come, here's the map. Shall we divide our right
sendMessage running    Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.
sendMessage running    Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?
sendMessage running    For we shall presently have need of you.
sendMessage running    On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting
sendMessage running    How now, lad? Is the wind in that door, i' faith? Must we all
sendMessage running    And either they or we must lower lie.                [Exit.]
sendMessage running    That with our small conjunction we should on,
sendMessage running    Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good
sendMessage running    It were not good; for therein should we read
sendMessage running  Doug. Faith, and so we should;
sendMessage running    For well you know we of the off'ring side
sendMessage running    All hot and bleeding Will we offer them.
sendMessage running  West. He is, Sir John. I fear we shall stay too long.
sendMessage running  Hot. The King is kind; and well we know the King
sendMessage running    Into his title, the which we find
sendMessage running  Hot. And may be so we shall.
sendMessage running    As now we meet. You have deceiv'd our trust
sendMessage running    To this we swore our aid. But in short space
sendMessage running    Whereby we stand opposed by such means
sendMessage running  King. And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
sendMessage running    We love our people well; even those we love
sendMessage running    For, on their answer, will we set on them,
sendMessage running  Wor. Then are we all undone.
sendMessage running    Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
sendMessage running    And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
sendMessage running    An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
sendMessage running    An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
sendMessage running  John. But, soft! whom have we here?
sendMessage running    grant you I was down, and out of breath, and so was he; but we
sendMessage running    Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
sendMessage running    Other offenders we will pause upon.
sendMessage running  King. Then this remains, that we divide our power.
sendMessage running    Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.
sendMessage running    Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
sendMessage running    That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one;
sendMessage running    And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
sendMessage running    And since we are o'erset, venture again.
sendMessage running    Come, we will put forth, body and goods.
sendMessage running    bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our
sendMessage running    How, in our means, we should advance ourselves
sendMessage running  HASTINGS. With him, we may.
sendMessage running    But if without him we be thought too feeble,
sendMessage running    My judgment is we should not step too far
sendMessage running    Till we had his assistance by the hand;
sendMessage running    That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
sendMessage running    And when we see the figure of the house,
sendMessage running    Then we must rate the cost of the erection;
sendMessage running    Which if we find outweighs ability,
sendMessage running    What do we then but draw anew the model
sendMessage running    And set another up- should we survey
sendMessage running    Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
sendMessage running    I think we are so a body strong enough,
sendMessage running    Even as we are, to equal with the King.
sendMessage running  MOWBRAY. Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?
sendMessage running  FANG. Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.
sendMessage running  PRINCE. Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the spirits
sendMessage running    Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?
sendMessage running  PRINCE. How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night in his
sendMessage running    the diseases, Doll. We catch of you, Doll, we catch of you; grant
sendMessage running    we not Hiren here?
sendMessage running    Shall we fall foul for toys?
sendMessage running  PISTOL. Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have we not Hiren
sendMessage running    Fear we broadsides? No, let the fiend give fire.
sendMessage running    Come we to full points here, and are etceteras nothings?
sendMessage running  PISTOL. Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf. What! we have seen the seven
sendMessage running  PISTOL. Thrust him down stairs! Know we not Galloway nags?
sendMessage running  PISTOL. What! shall we have incision? Shall we imbrue?
sendMessage running  PISTOL. What! shall we have incision? Shall we imbrue?
sendMessage running  FALSTAFF. Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and we
sendMessage running    you we knew where the bona-robas were, and had the best of them
sendMessage running  FALSTAFF. Shadow will serve for summer. Prick him; for we have a
sendMessage running  SHALLOW. O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the
sendMessage running  SHALLOW. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir
sendMessage running  SHALLOW. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir
sendMessage running  SHALLOW. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir
sendMessage running    John, we have. Our watchword was 'Hem, boys!' Come, let's to
sendMessage running    dinner; come, let's to dinner. Jesus, the days that we have seen!
sendMessage running  FEEBLE. By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God
sendMessage running    justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this
sendMessage running  MOWBRAY. Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
sendMessage running  MOWBRAY. The just proportion that we gave them out.
sendMessage running    Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd
sendMessage running    And we must bleed for it; of which disease
sendMessage running    What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
sendMessage running    Which long ere this we offer'd to the King,
sendMessage running    When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs,
sendMessage running  MOWBRAY. Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
sendMessage running    Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
sendMessage running    In sight of both our battles we may meet;
sendMessage running  ARCHBISHOP. My lord, we will do so.          Exit WESTMORELAND
sendMessage running  HASTINGS. Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
sendMessage running    If we do now make our atonement well,
sendMessage running  ARCHBISHOP. Before, and greet his Grace. My lord, we come.
sendMessage running  MOWBRAY. If not, we ready are to try our fortunes
sendMessage running  HASTINGS. And though we here fall down,
sendMessage running    As we will ours; and here, between the armies,
sendMessage running    March by us, that we may peruse the men
sendMessage running  PRINCE JOHN. I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.
sendMessage running    And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.
sendMessage running    And we with sober speed will follow you.
sendMessage running    Only we want a little personal strength;
sendMessage running  WARWICK. Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
sendMessage running  PRINCE HUMPHREY. He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
sendMessage running  WARWICK. When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
sendMessage running  WARWICK. When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
sendMessage running    again, sir- shall we sow the headland with wheat?
sendMessage running  CHIEF JUSTICE. Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!
sendMessage running    Now call we our high court of parliament;
sendMessage running    Our coronation done, we will accite,
sendMessage running  SHALLOW. Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour, we
sendMessage running  SILENCE. Ah, sirrah! quoth-a- we shall               [Singing]
sendMessage running  SILENCE. An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' th' night.
sendMessage running    And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
sendMessage running   The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram
sendMessage running   Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them
sendMessage running ELY. But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
sendMessage running   And therefore we must needs admit the means
sendMessage running CANTERBURY. Then go we in, to know his embassy;
sendMessage running  WESTMORELAND. Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Not yet, my cousin; we would be resolv'd,
sendMessage running    Before we hear him, of some things of weight
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Sure, we thank you.
sendMessage running    My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,
sendMessage running    For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,
sendMessage running    In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
sendMessage running    Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
sendMessage running    Now are we well resolv'd; and, by God's help
sendMessage running    Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
sendMessage running    Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
sendMessage running    Freely to render what we have in charge;
sendMessage running    Or shall we sparingly show you far of
sendMessage running    His present and your pains we thank you for.
sendMessage running    When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
sendMessage running    With chaces. And we understand him well,
sendMessage running    Not measuring what use we made of them.
sendMessage running    For we have now no thought in us but France,
sendMessage running    And thence to France shall we convey you safe
sendMessage running    To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
sendMessage running    Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.                 Exit
sendMessage running  HOSTESS. No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and board a
sendMessage running    their needles, but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house
sendMessage running    we shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
sendMessage running    together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one
sendMessage running  PISTOL. Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins, we will live.
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
sendMessage running    Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us
sendMessage running    For which we have in head assembled them?
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
sendMessage running    And on his more advice we pardon him.
sendMessage running    Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
sendMessage running  GREY, SCROOP. To which we all appeal.
sendMessage running    Touching our person seek we no revenge;
sendMessage running    But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
sendMessage running    To hinder our beginnings; we doubt not now
sendMessage running    And we must earn therefore.
sendMessage running  NYM. Shall we shog? The King will be gone from Southampton.
sendMessage running    It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
sendMessage running    Therefore, I say, 'tis meet we all go forth
sendMessage running    No, with no more than if we heard that England
sendMessage running    But though we think it so, it is no matter.
sendMessage running  FRENCH KING. Think we King Harry strong;
sendMessage running  FRENCH KING. For us, we will consider of this further;
sendMessage running    As we his subjects have in wonder found,
sendMessage running    trumpet call us to the breach; and we talk and, be Chrish, do
sendMessage running    This is the latest parle we will admit;
sendMessage running    The Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated,
sendMessage running    For we no longer are defensible.
sendMessage running    Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
sendMessage running    To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest;
sendMessage running    To-morrow for the march are we addrest.
sendMessage running    Poor we call them in their native lords!
sendMessage running    And that we are most lofty runaways.
sendMessage running    And let him say to England that we send
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. We would have all such offenders so cut off. And we
sendMessage running  MONTJOY. Thus says my king. Say thou to Harry of England: Though we
sendMessage running    seem'd dead we did but sleep; advantage is a better soldier than
sendMessage running    rashness. Tell him we could have rebuk'd him at Harfleur, but
sendMessage running    that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full
sendMessage running    ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial:
sendMessage running    proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost,
sendMessage running    proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost,
sendMessage running    the disgrace we have digested; which, in weight to re-answer, his
sendMessage running    Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
sendMessage running    If we may pass, we will; if we be hind'red,
sendMessage running    If we may pass, we will; if we be hind'red,
sendMessage running    If we may pass, we will; if we be hind'red,
sendMessage running    We would not seek a battle as we are;
sendMessage running    Nor as we are, we say, we will not shun it.
sendMessage running    Nor as we are, we say, we will not shun it.
sendMessage running    Nor as we are, we say, we will not shun it.
sendMessage running    Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for the dawning as we
sendMessage running  CONSTABLE. Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to
sendMessage running    eat, and none to fight. Now is it time to arm. Come, shall we
sendMessage running    Where- O for pity!- we shall much disgrace
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
sendMessage running    That we should dress us fairly for our end.
sendMessage running    Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
sendMessage running    coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be
sendMessage running  BATES. I think it be; but we have no great cause to desire the
sendMessage running  WILLIAMS. We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we
sendMessage running    fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
sendMessage running    we were quit here.
sendMessage running  WILLIAMS. That's more than we know.
sendMessage running  BATES. Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough if
sendMessage running  BATES. Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough if
sendMessage running    we know we are the King's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our
sendMessage running    we know we are the King's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our
sendMessage running    throats are cut he may be ransom'd, and we ne'er the wiser.
sendMessage running  BATES. Be friends, you English fools, be friends; we have
sendMessage running    How shall we then behold their natural tears?
sendMessage running    Though we upon this mountain's basis by
sendMessage running  DAUPHIN. Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits,
sendMessage running    The sun is high, and we outwear the day.              Exeunt
sendMessage running    If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
sendMessage running    If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
sendMessage running  WESTMORELAND. O that we now had here
sendMessage running    If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
sendMessage running    If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
sendMessage running    But we in it shall be remembered-
sendMessage running    We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
sendMessage running    We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
sendMessage running    Good argument, I hope, we will not fly-
sendMessage running    Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?
sendMessage running  ORLEANS. Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen;
sendMessage running    If they'll do neither, we will come to them
sendMessage running    Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,
sendMessage running    And not a man of them that we shall take
sendMessage running    That we may wander o'er this bloody field
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
sendMessage running    Ascribe we all. When, without stratagem,
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Come, go we in procession to the village;
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Do we all holy rites:
sendMessage running    Be here presented. Now we bear the King
sendMessage running    There must we bring him; and myself have play'd
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!
sendMessage running  FRENCH KING. Right joyous are we to behold your face,
sendMessage running    As we are now glad to behold your eyes-
sendMessage running    The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. To cry amen to that, thus we appear.
sendMessage running    To re-survey them, we will suddenly
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,
sendMessage running    beard? Shall we not? What say'st thou, my fair flower-de-luce?
sendMessage running    fashion; we are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty that
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Prepare we for our marriage; on which day,
sendMessage running  EXETER. We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?
sendMessage running    Upon a wooden coffin we attend;
sendMessage running    What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
sendMessage running    Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
sendMessage running  WINCHESTER. Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art
sendMessage running    O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
sendMessage running    Now we are victors, upon us he smiles.
sendMessage running    What towns of any moment but we have?
sendMessage running    At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
sendMessage running  REIGNIER. Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here?
sendMessage running    Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear;
sendMessage running  CHARLES. Sound, sound alarum; we will rush on them.
sendMessage running    By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
sendMessage running  REIGNIER. Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
sendMessage running  ALENCON. He may mean more than we poor men do know;
sendMessage running    Shall we give o'er Orleans, or no?
sendMessage running  FIRST WARDER.  [Within]  The Lord protect him! so we
sendMessage running    We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
sendMessage running    have we here?
sendMessage running    this day against God's peace and the King's, we charge
sendMessage running    But we shall meet and break our minds at large.
sendMessage running  MAYOR. See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
sendMessage running    But we will be reveng'd sufficiently.
sendMessage running    Now like to whelps we crying run away.
sendMessage running    In spite of us or aught that we could do.
sendMessage running    When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.
sendMessage running    No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
sendMessage running    Embrace we then this opportunity,
sendMessage running  BEDFORD. Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.
sendMessage running    That we do make our entrance several ways;
sendMessage running  BASTARD. Unready! Ay, and glad we 'scap'd so well.
sendMessage running    I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
sendMessage running    We'll follow them with all the power we have.
sendMessage running    But only, with your patience, that we may
sendMessage running  SUFFOLK. Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;
sendMessage running    And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
sendMessage running  FIRST SERVING-MAN. Nay, if we be forbidden stones, we'll
sendMessage running  SECOND SERVING-MAN. Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.
sendMessage running  THIRD SERVING-MAN. My lord, we know your Grace to be a
sendMessage running    And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
sendMessage running    Shall pitch a field when we are dead.          [Begin again]
sendMessage running  EXETER. Ay, we may march in England or in France,
sendMessage running    If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
sendMessage running    If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
sendMessage running    And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
sendMessage running    And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;
sendMessage running    That hardly we escap'd the pride of France.             Exit
sendMessage running    God b'uy, my lord; we came but to tell you
sendMessage running    That we are here.                      Exeunt from the walls
sendMessage running  TALBOT. And there will we be too, ere it be long,
sendMessage running  TALBOT. But ere we go, regard this dying prince,
sendMessage running    But gather we our forces out of hand
sendMessage running    Now will we take some order in the town,
sendMessage running  TALBOT. But yet, before we go, let's not forget
sendMessage running    And we will make thee famous through the world.
sendMessage running  CHARLES. Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
sendMessage running    Summon a parley; we will talk with him.
sendMessage running    Call we to mind-and mark but this for proof:
sendMessage running    And seek how we may prejudice the foe.                Exeunt
sendMessage running    Long since we were resolved of your truth,
sendMessage running    Because till now we never saw your face.
sendMessage running    Before we met or that a stroke was given,
sendMessage running    In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
sendMessage running    Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.
sendMessage running    Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason.
sendMessage running    And you, my lords, remember where we are:
sendMessage running    And that within ourselves we disagree,
sendMessage running    And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,
sendMessage running    Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
sendMessage running    I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
sendMessage running    For, I protest, we are well fortified,
sendMessage running    How are we park'd and bounded in a pale
sendMessage running    If we be English deer, be then in blood;
sendMessage running    So should we save a valiant gentleman
sendMessage running    That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep.
sendMessage running  YORK. He dies; we lose; I break my warlike word.
sendMessage running  TALBOT. If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
sendMessage running  TALBOT. If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
sendMessage running    All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
sendMessage running  CHARLES. O, no; forbear! For that which we have fled
sendMessage running  CHARLES. So we be rid of them, do with them what thou
sendMessage running    And therefore are we certainly resolv'd
sendMessage running    Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
sendMessage running    But we will presently provide for them.
sendMessage running    Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
sendMessage running    Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
sendMessage running  WARWICK. Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace,
sendMessage running    Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
sendMessage running    For here we entertain a solemn peace.                 Exeunt
sendMessage running    How shall we then dispense with that contract,
sendMessage running    Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,
sendMessage running    Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
sendMessage running    For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can;
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can;
sendMessage running    But now it is impossible we should.
sendMessage running    Join we together for the public good,
sendMessage running    In what we can, to bridle and suppress
sendMessage running    And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds
sendMessage running    When from Saint Albans we do make return
sendMessage running    will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our
sendMessage running  QUEEN. Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort
sendMessage running    Although we fancy not the Cardinal,
sendMessage running    Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
sendMessage running    Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
sendMessage running    But to the matter that we have in hand:
sendMessage running  SUFFOLK. Before we make election, give me leave
sendMessage running    speak them to me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
sendMessage running  BOLINGBROKE. Master Hume, we are therefore provided; will her
sendMessage running    you be by her aloft while we be busy below; and so I pray you go,
sendMessage running    That time best fits the work we have in hand.
sendMessage running    Madam, sit you, and fear not: whom we raise
sendMessage running    Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
sendMessage running    What have we here?                                   [Reads]
sendMessage running    That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
sendMessage running    have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Well, sir, we must have you find your legs.
sendMessage running  WIFE. Alas, sir, we did it for pure need!
sendMessage running    Whom we have apprehended in the fact,
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Well, for this night we will repose us here.
sendMessage running    Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
sendMessage running    And in this private plot be we the first
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
sendMessage running    For by his death we do perceive his guilt;
sendMessage running    Come, Stanley, shall we go?
sendMessage running    And go we to attire you for our journey.
sendMessage running    And if we did but glance a far-off look
sendMessage running    To rid us from the fear we have of him.
sendMessage running    But yet we want a colour for his death.
sendMessage running    And yet we have but trivial argument,
sendMessage running  YORK. And I. And now we three have spoke it,
sendMessage running    And what we do establish he confirms;
sendMessage running    But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
sendMessage running  SECOND MURDERER. O that it were to do! What have we done?
sendMessage running    Say we intend to try his Grace to-day,
sendMessage running    For it is known we were but hollow friends:
sendMessage running    Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?
sendMessage running  COMMONS. [Within] An answer from the King, or we will all break in!
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
sendMessage running    The lives of those which we have lost in fight
sendMessage running    But with our sword we wip'd away the blot;
sendMessage running    Far be it we should honour such as these
sendMessage running  LIEUTENANT. And as for these, whose ransom we have set,
sendMessage running    therefore should we be magistrates.
sendMessage running  DICK. The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
sendMessage running  CADE. But then are we in order when we are most out of order. Come,
sendMessage running  CADE. But then are we in order when we are most out of order. Come,
sendMessage running    to London, where we will have the mayor's sword borne before us.
sendMessage running  DICK. If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the gaols and
sendMessage running  JOHN. [Aside] Then we are like to have biting statutes, unless his
sendMessage running    Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,
sendMessage running    have it. Men shall hold of me in capite; and we charge and
sendMessage running  DICK. My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside, and take up
sendMessage running    borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the
sendMessage running    Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the King
sendMessage running    And Somerset, we will commit thee thither
sendMessage running    [Aside] Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
sendMessage running    For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.
sendMessage running  CLIFFORD. Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
sendMessage running  YORK. Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
sendMessage running  KING HENRY. Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.
sendMessage running    By what we can, which can no more but fly.
sendMessage running    If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
sendMessage running    Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape-
sendMessage running    As well we may, if not through your neglect-
sendMessage running    Away, for your relief! and we will live
sendMessage running    Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
sendMessage running    By th' mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:
sendMessage running    Well, lords, we have not got that which we have;
sendMessage running    Well, lords, we have not got that which we have;
sendMessage running    What says Lord Warwick? Shall we after them?
sendMessage running  WARWICK. After them? Nay, before them, if we can.
sendMessage running  YORK. While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north,
sendMessage running    For hither we have broken in by force.
sendMessage running    But little thinks we shall be of her council.
sendMessage running  RICHARD. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
sendMessage running  WESTMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
sendMessage running    That we are those which chas'd you from the field,
sendMessage running  YORK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
sendMessage running  QUEEN MARGARET. Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
sendMessage running    Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest
sendMessage running  YORK. Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
sendMessage running    Whom we have left protectors of the King,
sendMessage running    A woman's general; what should we fear?
sendMessage running    With this we charg'd again; but out alas!
sendMessage running    And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
sendMessage running    Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
sendMessage running    Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
sendMessage running    Or had he scap'd, methinks we should have heard
sendMessage running    Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
sendMessage running  RICHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
sendMessage running    Short tale to make- we at Saint Albans met,
sendMessage running    And we in them no hope to win the day;
sendMessage running    So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;
sendMessage running    For in the marches here we heard you were
sendMessage running    Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
sendMessage running    Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
sendMessage running    Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
sendMessage running    In every borough as we pass along;
sendMessage running    Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
sendMessage running  GEORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
sendMessage running    Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,
sendMessage running    We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
sendMessage running    What counsel give you? Whither shall we fly?
sendMessage running    And weak we are, and cannot shun pursuit.
sendMessage running    Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
sendMessage running    Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
sendMessage running    And if we thrive, promise them such rewards
sendMessage running    Forslow no longer; make we hence amain.               Exeunt
sendMessage running    And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
sendMessage running  GEORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
sendMessage running    And in this covert will we make our stand,
sendMessage running    Here stand we both, and aim we at the best;
sendMessage running    Here stand we both, and aim we at the best;
sendMessage running    In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
sendMessage running    To go along with us; for as we think,
sendMessage running    And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,
sendMessage running  SECOND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.
sendMessage running    For we were subjects but while you were king.
sendMessage running    Which we in justice cannot well deny,
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Widow, we will consider of your suit;
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
sendMessage running    While we bethink a means to break it off.
sendMessage running  QUEEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
sendMessage running    What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
sendMessage running  LEWIS. stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,
sendMessage running    Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow'r.          Exeunt
sendMessage running    Speak suddenly, my lords- are we all friends?
sendMessage running  SECOND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
sendMessage running  WARWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
sendMessage running    Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
sendMessage running    If Warwick take us, we are sure to die.               Exeunt
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. But whither shall we then?
sendMessage running    And we shall have more wars befor't be long.
sendMessage running    Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas,
sendMessage running    What then remains, we being thus arriv'd
sendMessage running    But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
sendMessage running    By fair or foul means we must enter in,
sendMessage running  MAYOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming
sendMessage running    For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
sendMessage running    Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
sendMessage running    I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
sendMessage running    Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;
sendMessage running    Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand;
sendMessage running    Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
sendMessage running    Shall rest in London till we come to him.
sendMessage running    And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,
sendMessage running    The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
sendMessage running    That we could hear no news of his repair?
sendMessage running    Stand we in good array, for they no doubt
sendMessage running  WARWICK. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
sendMessage running    Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
sendMessage running    And live we how we can, yet die we must.
sendMessage running    And live we how we can, yet die we must.
sendMessage running    And live we how we can, yet die we must.
sendMessage running  SOMERSET. Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,
sendMessage running    Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly!
sendMessage running    And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory.
sendMessage running    And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
sendMessage running    And as we march our strength will be augmented
sendMessage running    In every county as we go along.
sendMessage running    Let him depart before we need his help.
sendMessage running  SOMERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
sendMessage running  OXFORD. Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
sendMessage running  QUEEN MARGARET. So part we sadly in this troublous world,
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.
sendMessage running    Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
sendMessage running    Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride!
sendMessage running    Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
sendMessage running    And now what rests but that we spend the time
sendMessage running    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring
sendMessage running    To make that only true we now intend,
sendMessage running    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
sendMessage running    Since last we saw in France?
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham
sendMessage running    By violent swiftness that which we run at,
sendMessage running  QUEEN KATHARINE. Nay, we must longer kneel: I am suitor.
sendMessage running    Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
sendMessage running    For our best act. If we shall stand still,
sendMessage running    We should take root here where we sit, or sit
sendMessage running    A trembling contribution! Why, we take
sendMessage running    And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
sendMessage running    In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
sendMessage running    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
sendMessage running    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-
sendMessage running    Is business of estate, in which we come
sendMessage running    Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.
sendMessage running    The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
sendMessage running    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
sendMessage running    And kingly dignity, we are contented
sendMessage running    That we adjourn this court till further day;
sendMessage running    Into your private chamber, we shall give you
sendMessage running    You turn the good we offer into envy.
sendMessage running  WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
sendMessage running    Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.
sendMessage running    To trust us in your business, we are ready
sendMessage running    What we can do to him-though now the time
sendMessage running  SUFFOLK. He has; and we shall see him
sendMessage running  NORFOLK. My lord, we have
sendMessage running  KING. If we did think
sendMessage running    And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
sendMessage running    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
sendMessage running    For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.
sendMessage running  GRIFFITH. Madam, we are here.
sendMessage running    Deserve we no more reverence?
sendMessage running    And able means, we had not parted thus.
sendMessage running    And we must root him out. From your affairs
sendMessage running    It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness
sendMessage running    They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
sendMessage running    Why are we met in council?
sendMessage running    That chair stand empty; but we all are men,
sendMessage running    For so we are inform'd-with new opinions,
sendMessage running    Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,
sendMessage running  GARDINER. My lord, because we have business of more moment,
sendMessage running    When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
sendMessage running  GARDINER. Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven
sendMessage running    Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long
sendMessage running    Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons,
sendMessage running    dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? Or have we some
sendMessage running    As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,
sendMessage running    Not being torn a pieces, we have done.
sendMessage running    And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
sendMessage running    Which we have not done neither; that, I fear,
sendMessage running    For such a one we show'd 'em. If they smile
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. What follows if we disallow of this?
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
sendMessage running    Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
sendMessage running    But we will make it subject to this boy.
sendMessage running    That right in peace which here we urge in war,
sendMessage running    And then we shall repent each drop of blood
sendMessage running    Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.
sendMessage running    England we love, and for that England's sake
sendMessage running    With burden of our armour here we sweat.
sendMessage running    King Philip, determine what we shall do straight.
sendMessage running    For this down-trodden equity we tread
sendMessage running    Which here we came to spout against your town,
sendMessage running    In that behalf which we have challeng'd it;
sendMessage running    Or shall we give the signal to our rage,
sendMessage running  CITIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
sendMessage running    For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
sendMessage running  CITIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King,
sendMessage running    To him will we prove loyal. Till that time
sendMessage running    Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.
sendMessage running    That did display them when we first march'd forth;
sendMessage running  CITIZEN. Heralds, from off our tow'rs we might behold
sendMessage running    Both are alike, and both alike we like.
sendMessage running    In this hot trial more than we of France;
sendMessage running    Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
sendMessage running    We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
sendMessage running  CITIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King.
sendMessage running  CITIZEN. A greater pow'r than we denies all this;
sendMessage running    And till it be undoubted, we do lock
sendMessage running    I like it well. France, shall we knit our pow'rs
sendMessage running    Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town,
sendMessage running    As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
sendMessage running    And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
sendMessage running    The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
sendMessage running    As we to keep this city.
sendMessage running    And all that we upon this side the sea-
sendMessage running  KING PHILIP. And, by my faith, this league that we have made
sendMessage running    Brother of England, how may we content
sendMessage running    This widow lady? In her right we came;
sendMessage running    To our solemnity. I trust we shall,
sendMessage running    That we shall stop her exclamation.
sendMessage running    Go we as well as haste will suffer us
sendMessage running    But as we under heaven are supreme head,
sendMessage running    Where we do reign we will alone uphold,
sendMessage running    Where we do reign we will alone uphold,
sendMessage running    No longer than we well could wash our hands,
sendMessage running    Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
sendMessage running    If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
sendMessage running  KING PHILIP. What can go well, when we have run so ill.
sendMessage running    Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
sendMessage running    So we could find some pattern of our shame.
sendMessage running    That we shall see and know our friends in heaven;
sendMessage running  KING JOHN. Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
sendMessage running    To overbear it; and we are all well pleas'd,
sendMessage running    Since all and every part of what we would
sendMessage running    Which for our goods we do no further ask
sendMessage running    What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
sendMessage running  PEMBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
sendMessage running    It is our safety, and we must embrace
sendMessage running    Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
sendMessage running    To stop their marches fore we are inflam'd.
sendMessage running    They saw we had a purpose of defence.
sendMessage running    May know wherefore we took the sacrament,
sendMessage running    And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
sendMessage running    Wherein we step after a stranger-march
sendMessage running    If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.
sendMessage running    Even on that altar where we swore to you
sendMessage running    Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,
sendMessage running    In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
sendMessage running    After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
sendMessage running    Where God He knows how we shall answer him;
sendMessage running    Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
sendMessage running    As we with honour and respect may take,
sendMessage running  SALISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make,
sendMessage running    And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
sendMessage running    into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar
sendMessage running  MARULLUS. May we do so?
sendMessage running    We both have fed as well, and we can both
sendMessage running    The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
sendMessage running    But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
sendMessage running    Like a Colossus, and we petty men
sendMessage running    But in ourselves that we are underlings.
sendMessage running    As we have seen him in the Capitol,
sendMessage running    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
sendMessage running    For we will shake him, or worse days endure.           Exit.
sendMessage running    And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
sendMessage running    In favor's like the work we have in hand,
sendMessage running    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
sendMessage running  CASSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.
sendMessage running    Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?
sendMessage running    What need we any spur but our own cause
sendMessage running    That this shall be or we will fall for it?
sendMessage running  CASSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
sendMessage running    O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
sendMessage running  CASSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
sendMessage running  LIGARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
sendMessage running    I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
sendMessage running    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
sendMessage running    And we like friends will straightway go together.
sendMessage running    Be sudden, for we fear prevention.
sendMessage running  CAESAR. Are we all ready? What is now amiss
sendMessage running    But we the doers.
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Fates, we will know your pleasures.
sendMessage running    That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
sendMessage running    That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
sendMessage running    So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged
sendMessage running    Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,
sendMessage running  DECIUS. What, shall we forth?
sendMessage running    Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.
sendMessage running  CASSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
sendMessage running    Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
sendMessage running    You see we do, yet see you but our hands
sendMessage running  BRUTUS. Only be patient till we have appeased
sendMessage running    And then we will deliver you the cause
sendMessage running    Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
sendMessage running    And that we are contented Caesar shall
sendMessage running    When severally we hear them rendered.
sendMessage running    Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
sendMessage running    And though we lay these honors on this man
sendMessage running    Either led or driven, as we point the way;
sendMessage running    And having brought our treasure where we will,
sendMessage running    Then take we down his load and turn him off,
sendMessage running    Are levying powers; we must straight make head;
sendMessage running  OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
sendMessage running    Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
sendMessage running    But for supporting robbers, shall we now
sendMessage running    Now sit we close about this taper here,
sendMessage running    Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still
sendMessage running    From which advantage shall we cut him off
sendMessage running    If at Philippi we do face him there,
sendMessage running    That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
sendMessage running    On such a full sea are we now afloat,
sendMessage running    And we must take the current when it serves,
sendMessage running    Which we will niggard with a little rest.
sendMessage running    Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
sendMessage running  VARRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
sendMessage running    And we will follow.
sendMessage running    Answering before we do demand of them.
sendMessage running  CASSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
sendMessage running  OCTAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
sendMessage running  ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
sendMessage running  OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.
sendMessage running    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
sendMessage running    As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem
sendMessage running    The gods today stand friendly that we may,
sendMessage running    If we do lose this battle, then is this
sendMessage running    The very last time we shall speak together.
sendMessage running  CASSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,
sendMessage running    And whether we shall meet again I know not.
sendMessage running    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
sendMessage running    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
sendMessage running    If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
sendMessage running    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
sendMessage running    Thou know'st that we two went to school together;
sendMessage running  Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
sendMessage running     Give me the map there. Know we have divided
sendMessage running     Conferring them on younger strengths while we
sendMessage running     (Since now we will divest us both of rule,
sendMessage running     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
sendMessage running     That we our largest bounty may extend
sendMessage running     From whom we do exist and cease to be;
sendMessage running     Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
sendMessage running     Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride
sendMessage running     Five days we do allot thee for provision
sendMessage running     When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
sendMessage running  Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we
sendMessage running  Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we
sendMessage running     must we look to receive from his age, not alone the
sendMessage running  Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this
sendMessage running  Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are
sendMessage running     sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make
sendMessage running     we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
sendMessage running     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
sendMessage running     So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
sendMessage running  Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
sendMessage running     Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
sendMessage running     Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
sendMessage running     You we first seize on.
sendMessage running  Corn. You know not why we came to visit you-
sendMessage running     Wherein we must have use of your advice.
sendMessage running  Osw. Where may we set our horses?
sendMessage running     That, when we have found the King (in which your pain
sendMessage running     home; there's part of a power already footed; we must incline to
sendMessage running  Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.
sendMessage running  Edg. When we our betters see bearing our woes,
sendMessage running     company. The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous
sendMessage running     Though well we may not pass upon his life
sendMessage running  Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.
sendMessage running     So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'
sendMessage running     As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.
sendMessage running     What we are come about, and by no means
sendMessage running  Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
sendMessage running     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
sendMessage running  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come
sendMessage running  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come
sendMessage running  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come
sendMessage running  Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you.
sendMessage running     That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
sendMessage running  Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
sendMessage running     And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
sendMessage running     Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
sendMessage running     As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,
sendMessage running     As we shall find their merits and our safety
sendMessage running  Reg. That's as we list to grace him.
sendMessage running     One of them we behold.
sendMessage running     That we present us to him.
sendMessage running     Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
sendMessage running  Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,
sendMessage running     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
sendMessage running     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
sendMessage running     The oldest have borne most; we that are young
sendMessage running  KING. Why, that to know which else we should not know.
sendMessage running  BEROWNE. As we would hear an oracle.
sendMessage running    appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.
sendMessage running    time, which we may name tough.
sendMessage running    Before we enter his forbidden gates,
sendMessage running    Bold of your worthiness, we single you
sendMessage running    Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
sendMessage running    Which we much rather had depart withal,
sendMessage running    To-morrow shall we visit you again.
sendMessage running    No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
sendMessage running  BOYET. With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.'
sendMessage running    Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch;
sendMessage running    On Saturday we will return to France.
sendMessage running    That we must stand and play the murderer in?
sendMessage running  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Only for praise; and praise we may afford
sendMessage running  ROSALINE. If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
sendMessage running    And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should
sendMessage running    Which we of taste and feeling are- for those parts that do
sendMessage running    pauca verba. Away; the gentles are at their game, and we will to
sendMessage running    Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?
sendMessage running    Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
sendMessage running  BEROWNE. True, true, we are four.
sendMessage running    As true we are as flesh and blood can be.
sendMessage running    We cannot cross the cause why we were born,
sendMessage running    Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
sendMessage running  KING. But what of this? Are we not all in love?
sendMessage running    And where we are our learning likewise is;
sendMessage running    Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
sendMessage running    Do we not likewise see our learning there?
sendMessage running    O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
sendMessage running    And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
sendMessage running    Or women's sake, by whom we men are men-
sendMessage running    Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
sendMessage running    Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
sendMessage running  ARMADO. Arts-man, preambulate; we will be singuled from the
sendMessage running  HOLOFERNES. Allons! we will employ thee.
sendMessage running  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
sendMessage running  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
sendMessage running    Cried 'Via! we will do't, come what will come.'
sendMessage running    For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd;
sendMessage running    Upon the next occasion that we meet
sendMessage running  ROSALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
sendMessage running  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
sendMessage running    Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace;
sendMessage running    So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
sendMessage running  KING. Say to her we have measur'd many miles
sendMessage running  BEROWNE. Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
sendMessage running  BEROWNE. We number nothing that we spend for you;
sendMessage running    That we may do it still without accompt.
sendMessage running  KING. Why take we hands then?
sendMessage running  ROSALINE. Then cannot we be bought; and so adieu-
sendMessage running  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do
sendMessage running    And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
sendMessage running    Your wit makes wise things foolish; when we greet,
sendMessage running    By light we lose light; your capacity
sendMessage running    You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we
sendMessage running    You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we know what we
sendMessage running  COSTARD. Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
sendMessage running  COSTARD. We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take some care.
sendMessage running    too too vain; but we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la
sendMessage running    forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
sendMessage running  BEROWNE. False: we have given thee faces.
sendMessage running  BEROWNE. An thou wert a lion we would do so.
sendMessage running  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Speak, brave Hector; we are much delighted.
sendMessage running    If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
sendMessage running    For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
sendMessage running    Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
sendMessage running  KING. No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
sendMessage running  KING. Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
sendMessage running    You that way: we this way.                            Exeunt
sendMessage running  FIRST WITCH. When shall we three meet again?
sendMessage running    Nor would we deign him burial of his men
sendMessage running  BANQUO. Were such things here as we do speak about?
sendMessage running    Or have we eaten on the insane root
sendMessage running  BANQUO. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
sendMessage running    Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
sendMessage running    Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
sendMessage running    We still have judgement here, that we but teach
sendMessage running  MACBETH. If we should fail?
sendMessage running    When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
sendMessage running    As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
sendMessage running    Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
sendMessage running    At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.
sendMessage running  PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and
sendMessage running  MACBETH. The labor we delight in physics pain.
sendMessage running  LENNOX. The night has been unruly. Where we lay,
sendMessage running    So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
sendMessage running  MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Why do we hold our tongues,
sendMessage running    And when we have our naked frailties hid,
sendMessage running    Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are
sendMessage running  MACBETH. Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
sendMessage running    When therewithal we shall have cause of state
sendMessage running    The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
sendMessage running    Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
sendMessage running    Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
sendMessage running    'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
sendMessage running    Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
sendMessage running    Unsafe the while, that we
sendMessage running    Our offices and what we have to do
sendMessage running  MACBETH. Here had we now our country's honor roof'd,
sendMessage running    Those that we bury back, our monuments
sendMessage running    And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
sendMessage running    Would he were here! To all and him we thirst,
sendMessage running    To ratify the work, we may again
sendMessage running    All which we pine for now. And this report
sendMessage running    Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
sendMessage running    But cruel are the times when we are traitors
sendMessage running    And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
sendMessage running    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
sendMessage running    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
sendMessage running    Come, go we to the King; our power is ready,
sendMessage running    afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our
sendMessage running    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
sendMessage running  CAITHNESS. Well, march we on
sendMessage running    Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
sendMessage running    Make we our march towards Birnam.           Exeunt marching.
sendMessage running    And bear't before him; thereby shall we shadow
sendMessage running    Attend the true event, and put we on
sendMessage running    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
sendMessage running    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
sendMessage running    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
sendMessage running    Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
sendMessage running    Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,
sendMessage running    Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
sendMessage running  MALCOLM. I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
sendMessage running    Before we reckon with your several loves
sendMessage running    Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
sendMessage running    That we remember. There is our commission,
sendMessage running    From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
sendMessage running    For you must know we have with special soul
sendMessage running    Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
sendMessage running    As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
sendMessage running    That we may bring you something on the way.
sendMessage running    And we may soon our satisfaction have
sendMessage running    speech we had to such a purpose.
sendMessage running    A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
sendMessage running    A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
sendMessage running    Save that we do the denunciation lack
sendMessage running    Of outward order; this we came not to,
sendMessage running    From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
sendMessage running    Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;
sendMessage running    For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,
sendMessage running    Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,
sendMessage running    In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
sendMessage running    And make us lose the good we oft might win
sendMessage running    The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't,
sendMessage running    The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't,
sendMessage running    Because we see it; but what we do not see
sendMessage running    Because we see it; but what we do not see
sendMessage running    honour's reverence, for stew'd prunes. Sir, we had but two in the
sendMessage running    We kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
sendMessage running    With less respect than we do minister
sendMessage running    Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,
sendMessage running    Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
sendMessage running    Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
sendMessage running    But as we stand in fear-
sendMessage running    To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
sendMessage running    To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
sendMessage running    To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
sendMessage running    For we are soft as our complexions are,
sendMessage running    Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
sendMessage running    Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
sendMessage running    And the poor beetle that we tread upon
sendMessage running  CLAUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
sendMessage running    To what we fear of death.
sendMessage running    This being granted in course- and now follows all: we shall
sendMessage running    buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the
sendMessage running  ELBOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
sendMessage running    to be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a
sendMessage running    strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.
sendMessage running  DUKE. That we were all, as some would seem to be,
sendMessage running    we talk of were return'd again. This ungenitur'd agent will
sendMessage running    temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they
sendMessage running    that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not
sendMessage running    Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
sendMessage running    Do we jest now, think you?
sendMessage running    Just of his colour. What if we do omit
sendMessage running    And how shall we continue Claudio,
sendMessage running  ANGELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
sendMessage running    Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
sendMessage running    Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.         Exit
sendMessage running    Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.         Exit
sendMessage running    Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
sendMessage running    Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
sendMessage running    We have made inquiry of you, and we hear
sendMessage running    To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
sendMessage running  ESCALUS. In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon
sendMessage running  ESCALUS. The Duke's in us; and we will hear you speak;
sendMessage running    Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
sendMessage running  DUKE. Never crave him; we are definitive.
sendMessage running  BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.
sendMessage running    I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
sendMessage running  LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
sendMessage running    Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the
sendMessage running  ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
sendMessage running    'Shylock, we would have moneys.' You say so-
sendMessage running  LAUNCELOT. Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
sendMessage running  BASSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.
sendMessage running    By what we do to-night.
sendMessage running    Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
sendMessage running    But we will visit you at supper-time.                 Exeunt
sendMessage running  LORENZO. Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
sendMessage running  LORENZO. 'Tis now but four o'clock; we have two hours
sendMessage running  SALERIO. 'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
sendMessage running    And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
sendMessage running  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?
sendMessage running  SALERIO. Do we so.                                      Exeunt
sendMessage running    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
sendMessage running    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
sendMessage running    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
sendMessage running    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
sendMessage running    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
sendMessage running    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
sendMessage running  GRATIANO. No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down-
sendMessage running    We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
sendMessage running    And there we will abide. I do desire you
sendMessage running    So fare you well till we shall meet again.
sendMessage running    That they shall think we are accomplished
sendMessage running    With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
sendMessage running    When we are both accoutred like young men,
sendMessage running  NERISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?
sendMessage running    For we must measure twenty miles to-day.              Exeunt
sendMessage running  LAUNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow
sendMessage running    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all
sendMessage running    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the
sendMessage running    the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
sendMessage running    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we
sendMessage running    Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy,
sendMessage running    I pray you, know me when we meet again;
sendMessage running    And in the morning early will we both
sendMessage running  LORENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
sendMessage running    But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
sendMessage running    And yet no matter- why should we go in?
sendMessage running    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
sendMessage running    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
sendMessage running  PORTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall.
sendMessage running  NERISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
sendMessage running    Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
sendMessage running    What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it?
sendMessage running    What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it?
sendMessage running    And we will answer all things faithfully.
sendMessage running    overtake seventeen years old. It were a goot motion if we

sendMessage running    discreetly as we can.
sendMessage running  PAGE. Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
sendMessage running    hot venison pasty to dinner; come, gentlemen, I hope we
sendMessage running  SHALLOW. Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word
sendMessage running    it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and
sendMessage running  PAGE. Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.
sendMessage running    will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
sendMessage running  QUICKLY. Will I? I' faith, that we will; and I will tell your
sendMessage running    worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence;
sendMessage running  MRS. PAGE. Go in with us and see; we have an hour's talk
sendMessage running  HOST. Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?
sendMessage running    one. Though we are justices, and doctors, and churchmen,
sendMessage running    Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us; we are
sendMessage running    Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us; we are
sendMessage running    There will we make our peds of roses,
sendMessage running    desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog our prains
sendMessage running  SLENDER. And so must I, sir; we have appointed to dine with
sendMessage running    Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have
sendMessage running  SHALLOW. Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer
sendMessage running  MRS. PAGE. Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
sendMessage running  MRS. PAGE. I Will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have
sendMessage running  MRS. FORD. Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
sendMessage running    we had embrac'd, kiss'd, protested, and, as it were, spoke
sendMessage running    Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.            Exeunt
sendMessage running  MRS. FORD. How might we disguise him?
sendMessage running  MRS. PAGE. Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse
sendMessage running    We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
sendMessage running    are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pass
sendMessage running  MRS. FORD. Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd
sendMessage running  MRS. FORD. Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd
sendMessage running    afflicted, we two will still be the ministers.
sendMessage running    Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
sendMessage running  MRS. PAGE. That likewise have we thought upon, and
sendMessage running  PAGE. Come, come; we'll couch i' th' Castle ditch till we

sendMessage running    white and cry 'mum'; she cries 'budget,' and by that we

sendMessage running    Park; we two must go together.
sendMessage running  PAGE. Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now.
sendMessage running  MRS. FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never
sendMessage running  MRS. FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never
sendMessage running  MRS. PAGE. Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would
sendMessage running    Which by no means we may extenuate-
sendMessage running  EGEUS. With duty and desire we follow you.
sendMessage running  LYSANDER. Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
sendMessage running    Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
sendMessage running    Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight
sendMessage running    the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in
sendMessage running    the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in
sendMessage running    the city, we shall be dogg'd with company, and our devices known.
sendMessage running  BOTTOM. We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and
sendMessage running  QUINCE. At the Duke's oak we meet.
sendMessage running    Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
sendMessage running    And thorough this distemperature we see
sendMessage running    When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,
sendMessage running    So that but one heart we can make of it;
sendMessage running  BOTTOM. Are we all met?
sendMessage running    brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will
sendMessage running    brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will
sendMessage running  STARVELING. I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is
sendMessage running    prologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm
sendMessage running  QUINCE. Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written
sendMessage running    we ought to look to't.
sendMessage running  SNOUT. Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
sendMessage running    window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the
sendMessage running    of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a wall in
sendMessage running  PUCK. What hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here,
sendMessage running  ALL. Where shall we go?
sendMessage running                Shall we their fond pageant see?
sendMessage running    Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,
sendMessage running    The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
sendMessage running    When we have chid the hasty-footed time
sendMessage running    Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
sendMessage running  OBERON. But we are spirits of another sort:
sendMessage running              Trip we after night's shade.
sendMessage running    And since we have the vaward of the day,
sendMessage running    Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
sendMessage running    Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
sendMessage running    That we are awake? It seems to me
sendMessage running    That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
sendMessage running    That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
sendMessage running  DEMETRIUS. Why, then, we are awake; let's follow him;
sendMessage running    forward, we had all been made men.
sendMessage running    onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not
sendMessage running  THESEUS. Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
sendMessage running    What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
sendMessage running    How shall we find the concord of this discord?
sendMessage running  THESEUS. And we will hear it.
sendMessage running  PROLOGUE. If we offend, it is with our good will.
sendMessage running    That you should think, we come not to offend,
sendMessage running    Consider then, we come but in despite.
sendMessage running  THESEUS. If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,
sendMessage running    in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay
sendMessage running    I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,
sendMessage running    As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
sendMessage running    A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
sendMessage running             And we fairies, that do run
sendMessage running                Will we sing, and bless this place.
sendMessage running  PUCK.      If we shadows have offended,
sendMessage running             If you pardon, we will mend.
sendMessage running             If we have unearned luck
sendMessage running             Give me your hands, if we be friends,
sendMessage running    the stuffing--well, we are all mortal.
sendMessage running    we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays
sendMessage running    I know we shall have revelling to-night.
sendMessage running    I am subdued. Would the cook were o' my mind! Shall we go prove
sendMessage running    He shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry
sendMessage running    stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
sendMessage running    Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are
sendMessage running  Pedro. Come, shall we hear this music?
sendMessage running    some excellent music; for to-morrow night we would have it at the
sendMessage running    we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry
sendMessage running    sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of
sendMessage running  Pedro. Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter. Let it
sendMessage running    As we do trace this alley up and down,
sendMessage running    So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
sendMessage running  Hero. Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
sendMessage running    Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
sendMessage running  2. Watch. If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on
sendMessage running  2. Watch. If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on
sendMessage running  2. Watch. Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here
sendMessage running  2. Watch. Never speak, we charge you. Let us obey you to go with
sendMessage running  Dog. It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke's
sendMessage running    aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined
sendMessage running  Verg. And we must do it wisely.
sendMessage running    That what we have we prize not to the worth
sendMessage running    That what we have we prize not to the worth
sendMessage running    Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
sendMessage running    Why, then we rack the value, then we find
sendMessage running    Why, then we rack the value, then we find
sendMessage running  Both. Yea, sir, we hope.

sendMessage running  Con. Marry, sir, we say we are none.
sendMessage running  Bora. Sir, I say to you we are none.
sendMessage running  Pedro. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
sendMessage running  Pedro. See, see! Here comes the man we went to seek.
sendMessage running  Pedro. Leonato and his brother. What think'st thou? Had we fought,
sendMessage running    I doubt we should have been too young for them.
sendMessage running  Claud. We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof
sendMessage running    wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrel--draw to
sendMessage running  Pedro. But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the
sendMessage running  Marg. Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
sendMessage running    And then to Leonato's we will go.
sendMessage running    Than this for whom we rend'red up this woe.          Exeunt.
sendMessage running  Bene. Come, come, we are friends. Let's have a dance ere we are
sendMessage running  Bene. Come, come, we are friends. Let's have a dance ere we are
sendMessage running    married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels.
sendMessage running    if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you
sendMessage running    think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a
sendMessage running    Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
sendMessage running    To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
sendMessage running    That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,
sendMessage running  DUKE. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
sendMessage running    We lose it not so long as we can smile.
sendMessage running    though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency,
sendMessage running    have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
sendMessage running  IAGO. Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
sendMessage running    that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed
sendMessage running    But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings,
sendMessage running  RODERIGO. Where shall we meet i' the morning?
sendMessage running    Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
sendMessage running    Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
sendMessage running  CASSIO. Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
sendMessage running    Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
sendMessage running    enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should,
sendMessage running    Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
sendMessage running  FIRST MUSICIAN. Well, sir, we will not.
sendMessage running    Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
sendMessage running  OTHELLO. This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
sendMessage running    Whereto we see in all things nature tends-
sendMessage running    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
sendMessage running    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
sendMessage running  IAGO. Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
sendMessage running    They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
sendMessage running    Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,
sendMessage running    I do entreat that we may sup together.
sendMessage running    Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
sendMessage running    Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
sendMessage running    Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
sendMessage running    It is so too. And have not we affections,
sendMessage running    The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
sendMessage running    Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
sendMessage running    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
sendMessage running    Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
sendMessage running    This we prescribe, though no physician;
sendMessage running  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, throw down; we bid.
sendMessage running    Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
sendMessage running    Since we can not atone you, we shall see
sendMessage running    Since we can not atone you, we shall see
sendMessage running    Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
sendMessage running    Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
sendMessage running    That which in mean men we entitle patience
sendMessage running    Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
sendMessage running    While we return these dukes what we decree.
sendMessage running    While we return these dukes what we decree.
sendMessage running    And list what with our council we have done.
sendMessage running    And for we think the eagle-winged pride
sendMessage running    Therefore we banish you our territories.
sendMessage running    Our part therein we banish with yourselves,
sendMessage running    To keep the oath that we administer:
sendMessage running    Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
sendMessage running    For we will make for Ireland presently.
sendMessage running    Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!
sendMessage running    Towards our assistance we do seize to us
sendMessage running  KING RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands
sendMessage running    And we create, in absence of ourself,
sendMessage running    Come on, our queen; to-morrow must we part;
sendMessage running    But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
sendMessage running    And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
sendMessage running  ROSS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
sendMessage running    If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
sendMessage running    Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
sendMessage running    How shall we do for money for these wars?
sendMessage running    Well, somewhat we must do.-Come, cousin,
sendMessage running    Because we ever have been near the King.
sendMessage running  BUSHY. Well, we may meet again.
sendMessage running    He was not so resolv'd when last we spake together.
sendMessage running  BOLINGBROKE. An offer, uncle, that we will accept.
sendMessage running    But we must win your Grace to go with us
sendMessage running  CAPTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days
sendMessage running    And yet we hear no tidings from the King;
sendMessage running    Therefore we will disperse ourselves. Farewell.
sendMessage running  CAPTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.
sendMessage running    And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
sendMessage running    And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
sendMessage running  AUMERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
sendMessage running    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
sendMessage running    Ye favourites of a king; are we not high?
sendMessage running    Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend;
sendMessage running    If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.
sendMessage running    And yet not so-for what can we bequeath
sendMessage running    And nothing can we can our own but death
sendMessage running    What say you now? What comfort have we now?
sendMessage running  BOLINGBROKE. So that by this intelligence we learn
sendMessage running    Go, signify as much, while here we march
sendMessage running      have we stood
sendMessage running    Because we thought ourself thy lawful King;
sendMessage running    And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
sendMessage running    If we be not, show us the hand of God
sendMessage running    For well we know no hand of blood and bone
sendMessage running    And we are barren and bereft of friends,
sendMessage running    [To AUMERLE] We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
sendMessage running    Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
sendMessage running    Or shall we play the wantons with our woes
sendMessage running    For do we must what force will have us do.
sendMessage running  QUEEN. What sport shall we devise here in this garden
sendMessage running    As we this garden! We at time of year
sendMessage running    Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
sendMessage running    Till we assign you to your days of trial
sendMessage running    Of capital treason we arrest you here.
sendMessage running    He may surrender; so we shall proceed
sendMessage running    Little are we beholding to your love,
sendMessage running  BOLINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
sendMessage running  ABBOT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
sendMessage running    From which awak'd, the truth of what we are
sendMessage running  QUEEN. And must we be divided? Must we part?
sendMessage running  QUEEN. And must we be divided? Must we part?
sendMessage running    To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
sendMessage running    To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
sendMessage running    Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
sendMessage running    Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
sendMessage running    That we may arm us to encounter it.
sendMessage running    The chopping French we do not understand.
sendMessage running  BOLINGBROKE. Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
sendMessage running    But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
sendMessage running    We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
sendMessage running    If we will keep in favour with the King,
sendMessage running    You may partake of any thing we say:
sendMessage running    We speak no treason, man; we say the King
sendMessage running  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning,
sendMessage running    God grant we never may have need of you!
sendMessage running    So should we you, if you should be our king.
sendMessage running    That we may be admitted where he is.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
sendMessage running    Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,
sendMessage running    That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
sendMessage running    reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
sendMessage running  SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.
sendMessage running  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.
sendMessage running  SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?
sendMessage running  KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
sendMessage running    Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
sendMessage running    Who told me, when we both lay in the field
sendMessage running  SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
sendMessage running    How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
sendMessage running  CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
sendMessage running    Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine
sendMessage running    As index to the story we late talk'd of,
sendMessage running  FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be
sendMessage running    'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
sendMessage running    Ensuing danger; as by proof we see
sendMessage running  SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
sendMessage running  YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
sendMessage running  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to
sendMessage running    Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
sendMessage running    Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
sendMessage running    As closely to conceal what we impart.
sendMessage running    For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
sendMessage running  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
sendMessage running  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will
sendMessage running    And we will both together to the Tower,
sendMessage running    What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.
sendMessage running    Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet:
sendMessage running    Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt
sendMessage running  HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met
sendMessage running  BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know
sendMessage running    Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
sendMessage running  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
sendMessage running    Or that we would, against the form of law,
sendMessage running  BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die
sendMessage running  GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
sendMessage running    Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
sendMessage running    And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
sendMessage running    No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
sendMessage running    But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.
sendMessage running    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
sendMessage running    Which here we waken to our country's good,
sendMessage running    Which to recure, we heartily solicit
sendMessage running    So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
sendMessage running    As well we know your tenderness of heart
sendMessage running    Which we have noted in you to your kindred
sendMessage running    But we will plant some other in the throne
sendMessage running    And in this resolution here we leave you.
sendMessage running  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;
sendMessage running    And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.
sendMessage running    But shall we wear these glories for a day;
sendMessage running    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
sendMessage running    What! we have many goodly days to see.
sendMessage running  KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in
sendMessage running  KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason
sendMessage running    Have we march'd on without impediment;
sendMessage running    And here receive we from our father Stanley
sendMessage running    Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
sendMessage running  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we
sendMessage running  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we
sendMessage running    That we may praise Thee in the victory!
sendMessage running    Richard except, those whom we fight against
sendMessage running    They thus directed, we will follow
sendMessage running    If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
sendMessage running    Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
sendMessage running    And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
sendMessage running    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
sendMessage running  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
sendMessage running  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
sendMessage running    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
sendMessage running    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
sendMessage running    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
sendMessage running    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
sendMessage running    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
sendMessage running    Or shall we on without apology?
sendMessage running  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
sendMessage running    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
sendMessage running  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
sendMessage running    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
sendMessage running    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
sendMessage running    Come, shall we go?
sendMessage running    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
sendMessage running    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
sendMessage running    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
sendMessage running    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
sendMessage running    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
sendMessage running  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
sendMessage running    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
sendMessage running    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
sendMessage running  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for
sendMessage running    Immediately we do exile him hence.
sendMessage running    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
sendMessage running    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
sendMessage running    That we have had no time to move our daughter.
sendMessage running    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
sendMessage running    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
sendMessage running    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
sendMessage running    That we may call it early by-and-by.
sendMessage running  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
sendMessage running    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
sendMessage running    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
sendMessage running    And that we have a curse in having her.
sendMessage running    For here we need it not.
sendMessage running    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
sendMessage running    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
sendMessage running  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
sendMessage running  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
sendMessage running  Cap. All things that we ordained festival
sendMessage running  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
sendMessage running    Suspecting that we both were in a house
sendMessage running    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
sendMessage running    A greater power than we can contradict
sendMessage running    Till we can clear these ambiguities
sendMessage running    chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, paucas
sendMessage running  FIRST HUNTSMAN. My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
sendMessage running    He is no less than what we say he is.
sendMessage running  PLAYER. Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,
sendMessage running    Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.
sendMessage running    O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
sendMessage running    Only, good master, while we do admire
sendMessage running    Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly
sendMessage running    advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to
sendMessage running    Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free
sendMessage running    Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
sendMessage running    Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.
sendMessage running  PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
sendMessage running  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
sendMessage running  HORTENSIO. I promis'd we would be contributors
sendMessage running  GREMIO. And so we will- provided that he win her.
sendMessage running    You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
sendMessage running    To whom we all rest generally beholding.
sendMessage running    Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
sendMessage running    And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
sendMessage running  GREMIO, TRANIO. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.
sendMessage running    And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
sendMessage running    Now is the day we long have looked for;
sendMessage running    And when in music we have spent an hour,
sendMessage running    And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;
sendMessage running  BIANCA. Where left we last?
sendMessage running    port- 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
sendMessage running    And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
sendMessage running    First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
sendMessage running    The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
sendMessage running  TRANIO. That by degrees we mean to look into
sendMessage running    Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
sendMessage running    Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my
sendMessage running    That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
sendMessage running  TRANIO. Mistress, we have.
sendMessage running  LUCENTIO. Then we are rid of Licio.
sendMessage running    Will we return unto thy father's house
sendMessage running  PETRUCHIO. Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
sendMessage running    And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
sendMessage running    There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
sendMessage running    And well we may come there by dinner-time.
sendMessage running    Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
sendMessage running    And happily we might be interrupted.
sendMessage running    Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
sendMessage running  HORTENSIO. Say as he says, or we shall never go.
sendMessage running  KATHERINA. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
sendMessage running    And wander we to see thy honest son,
sendMessage running    good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vicentio! Now we
sendMessage running  BIONDELLO. O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him, forswear
sendMessage running    him, or else we are all undone.
sendMessage running  VINCENTIO. Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but I
sendMessage running  PETRUCHIO. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
sendMessage running    For now we sit to chat as well as eat.            [They sit]
sendMessage running    Shall win the wager which we will propose.
sendMessage running  WIDOW. Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.
sendMessage running    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
sendMessage running    we run ourselves aground; bestir, bestir.               Exit
sendMessage running    silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not
sendMessage running    Yet again! What do you here? Shall we give o'er, and
sendMessage running    we are less afraid to be drown'd than thou art.
sendMessage running    We split, we split! Farewell, my wife and children!
sendMessage running    Farewell, brother! We split, we split, we split!]
sendMessage running    Farewell, brother! We split, we split, we split!]
sendMessage running    A time before we came unto this cell?
sendMessage running    What foul play had we that we came from thence?
sendMessage running    What foul play had we that we came from thence?
sendMessage running    Or blessed was't we did?
sendMessage running    By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;
sendMessage running  MIRANDA. How came we ashore?
sendMessage running    Some food we had and some fresh water that
sendMessage running    Here in this island we arriv'd; and here
sendMessage running    As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
sendMessage running    So have we all, of joy; for our escape
sendMessage running    we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the
sendMessage running  SEBASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
sendMessage running  GONZALO. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
sendMessage running    as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of
sendMessage running    Than we bring men to comfort them;
sendMessage running  ANTONIO. 'Twas you we laugh'd at.
sendMessage running  SEBASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
sendMessage running    Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
sendMessage running    That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
sendMessage running    Or that we quit this place. Let's draw our weapons.
sendMessage running    pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or
sendMessage running  STEPHANO. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you
sendMessage running    being drown'd, we will inherit here. Here, bear my bottle.
sendMessage running  STEPHANO. Tell not me-when the butt is out we will drink
sendMessage running    say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of
sendMessage running    Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
sendMessage running    Will we take throughly.
sendMessage running    They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
sendMessage running  GONZALO. Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
sendMessage running    Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
sendMessage running    Hear a foot fall; we now are near his cell.
sendMessage running  TRINCULO. O, ho, monster; we know what belongs to a
sendMessage running  BOATSWAIN. The best news is that we have safely found
sendMessage running    Which but three glasses since we gave out split-
sendMessage running    And-how, we know not-all clapp'd under hatches;
sendMessage running    Even in a dream, were we divided from them,
sendMessage running  POET. When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,
sendMessage running    Ere we depart we'll share a bounteous time
sendMessage running  FIRST LORD. He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in
sendMessage running  SECOND LORD. Long may he live in fortunes! shall we in?
sendMessage running    If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
sendMessage running  FIRST LORD. My lord, we always have confess'd it.
sendMessage running  FIRST LORD. Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
sendMessage running    would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of
sendMessage running    our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.
sendMessage running    need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em?
sendMessage running    need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em?
sendMessage running    They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne'er
sendMessage running    are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call
sendMessage running    Upon whose age we void it up again
sendMessage running  ALL. So are we all.
sendMessage running  CAPHIS. Would we were all discharg'd!
sendMessage running    are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
sendMessage running  APEMANTUS. Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a
sendMessage running    And we alive that liv'd? Fly, damned baseness,
sendMessage running  FIRST STRANGER. We know him for no less, though we are but
sendMessage running  HORTENSIUS. Lucius! What, do we meet together?
sendMessage running  TITUS. O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
sendMessage running    Such valour in the bearing, what make we
sendMessage running  FIRST LORD. Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red.
sendMessage running  SECOND LORD. The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
sendMessage running    harshly o' th' trumpet's sound; we shall to't presently.
sendMessage running    a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon
sendMessage running    Are we undone, cast off, nothing remaining?
sendMessage running  SECOND SERVANT. As we do turn our backs
sendMessage running    Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
sendMessage running    Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
sendMessage running    and flourish with the highest. Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender
sendMessage running    Then do we sin against our own estate
sendMessage running    When we may profit meet and come too late.
sendMessage running  BOTH. What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
sendMessage running    What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
sendMessage running    Live with authority. So soon we shall drive back
sendMessage running    Whom, though in general part we were oppos'd,

sendMessage running    Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
sendMessage running    That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
sendMessage running    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
sendMessage running    Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
sendMessage running    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
sendMessage running  LUCIUS. See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
sendMessage running    Patricians and plebeians, we create
sendMessage running    Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.
sendMessage running    There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
sendMessage running  QUINTUS & MARTIUS. And shall, or him we will accompany.
sendMessage running    Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
sendMessage running  SATURNINUS. Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
sendMessage running    But if we live we'll be as sharp with you.
sendMessage running    That what we did was mildly as we might,
sendMessage running    That what we did was mildly as we might,
sendMessage running  TAMORA. Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends.
sendMessage running    Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.
sendMessage running    Then should not we be tir'd with this ado.
sendMessage running    Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
sendMessage running    Will we acquaint with all what we intend;
sendMessage running    Will we acquaint with all what we intend;
sendMessage running  DEMETRIUS. Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
sendMessage running    Now question me no more; we are espied.
sendMessage running  BASSIANUS. Who have we here? Rome's royal Emperess,
sendMessage running  TAMORA. But when ye have the honey we desire,
sendMessage running  CHIRON. I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
sendMessage running    Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
sendMessage running    But, out alas! here have we found him dead.
sendMessage running    SATURNINUS.  [Reads]  'An if we miss to meet him handsomely,
sendMessage running    Sweet huntsman- Bassianus 'tis we mean-
sendMessage running    Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
sendMessage running    There let them bide until we have devis'd
sendMessage running    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
sendMessage running    And in the fountain shall we gaze so long,
sendMessage running    Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?
sendMessage running    Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
sendMessage running    What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues
sendMessage running    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
sendMessage running    Lest we remember still that we have none.
